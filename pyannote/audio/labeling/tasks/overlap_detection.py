        Task
    feature_extraction : Wrappable
        Describes how features should be obtained.
        See pyannote.audio.features.wrapper.Wrapper documentation for details.
    protocol : Protocol
    subset : {'train', 'development', 'test'}, optional
        Protocol and subset.
    resolution : `pyannote.core.SlidingWindow`, optional
        Override `feature_extraction.sliding_window`. This is useful for
        models that include the feature extraction step (e.g. SincNet) and
        therefore output a lower sample rate than that of the input.
        Defaults to `feature_extraction.sliding_window`
    alignment : {'center', 'loose', 'strict'}, optional
        Which mode to use when cropping labels. This is useful for models that
        include the feature extraction step (e.g. SincNet) and therefore use a
        different cropping mode. Defaults to 'center'.
    duration : float, optional
        Duration of audio chunks. Defaults to 2s.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size. Defaults to 32.
    per_epoch : float, optional
        Force total audio duration per epoch, in days.
        Defaults to total duration of protocol subset.
    snr_min, snr_max : float, optional
        Defines Signal-to-Overlap Ratio range in dB. Defaults to [0, 10].
